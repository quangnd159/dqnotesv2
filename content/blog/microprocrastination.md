Recently, it has crept back into my life: when waiting for a website to load, I'd open the email app to see if there's anything new (and hopefully interesting) waiting in the inbox.

The good thing is the pilot in me is aware of something being off and takes corrective measures.

Autopilot is nice, until you mistake your mess of a life for living true to yourself, a false sense of freedom, of spontaneity.

Habits should not be accidental, for what is your identity but a bunch of habits in thinking and acting? Would you want an accidental existence? Certainly not.
